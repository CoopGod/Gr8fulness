# Gr8fulness
A flask application which seeks to make cataloging gratitude **easy and private.** 
**100% free**. No ads. Just an oppurtunity to find some peace.

[From the Book of Experimental Social Psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103117308569), gratitude can lower risks of heart disease, lower the severity of some symptoms of depression, instill healthier eating habits, and more. It takes less than a minute to write out what you're grateful for, and the benefits are positive and worthwhile.

This application was built using python's *Flask* library as a back-end, *HTML+CSS* with *Jinja* and a hint of JS for the front-end, and SQL's *SQLAlchemy* with *Postgres* as a database.
